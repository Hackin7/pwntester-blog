Those were a customerâ€™s words when an XML External Entity injection vulnerability was reported on one of his applications and although these kinds of attacks are known since the early 2000s I'm still under the impression that they are not known and tested enough by application developers and security auditors. Actually during this research we found complete frameworks like SpringMVC being vulnerable to XXE injection.
