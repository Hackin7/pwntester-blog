I have been thinking about starting a blog for a while but never got something to say that could not be found googling around (or that was too secret to tell in public :) ). Anyway, Ive being doing some research lately on secure coding on Android applications and I found OWASP goatDroid very instructive and formative but although the source code is freely available [here](https://github.com/jackMannino/OWASP-GoatDroid-Project). I could not find a comprehensive list of vulnerabilities present in the code so I decided to start a serie of posts about Android vulnerabilities using goatdroid to show them off. I hope you enjoy it ;)
